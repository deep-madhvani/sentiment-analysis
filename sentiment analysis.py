"""# **Approach 1: Topic Modeling**

**Overview**

*  Prepare the dataset by padding the comments and tokenizing the tokens.

* Using spaCy to eliminate commas and extract phrases with important teacher evaluation and difficulty-related words. With named entity recognition, quick access to word vectors, and extremely quick and accurate syntactic analysis, spaCy is a powerful tool to be use here.

* Building a neural network with Keras to determine whether a comment is connected to teacher evaluation or level of difficulty.

* Analyzing the model's performance using the test data set's correctness.

* We have also used the text-processing.com API which is a simple JSON over HTTP web service for text mining and natural language processing.

**Analyzing**

>We obtain accuracy of **71%** for star rating and **63%** for difficulty over the training data set.

>We used different dataset to test, over the test data set we get accuracy of **62%** for star rating and accuracy of **54%**  for difficulty

Topic modeling is useful when we try to get hidden patterns from text data, which can be beneficial in identifying important aspects of the text data.

The results is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of topics to be extracted, which might hinder our accuracy.

*We consider tolerance of 1 in testing*

**Overview**

In this approach, we are using Glove, the pre-trained word embedding.
We have also scaled the star and difficulty from 0 to 1. After that we gave this data to an RNN model.

Model architecture as follows,

Embedding layer - Dropout layer - 1-D convolution layer - 1-D Max Pooling - Bidirectional LSTM - Dense Layer

We have also used the text-processing.com API which is a simple JSON over HTTP web service for text mining and natural language processing.

The dataset we used for this project is provided by the professor.
We have used the large dataset for training and small dataset for testing.


**What do we conclude ?**

> We have tried many approach and in almost all of them we got MSE of around 1.

>Sentiment Intensity Analysis V1 is a good approach but the V2 wins the race with text cleaning.

>Sentiment Intensity Analysis Version 2 performs the best with star rating of 65% and difficulty rating of 73%.

> Although we got validation accuracy of more that 84% in Approach 4, the testing accuracy is 51%. So, it seems this model is overfitted.

# Future Scope

**Approaches**


>Compare similarity based on a predetermined dataframe containing a collection of comments which are refined to achieve a maximum attaniable upper and lower bound for ratings and score.

for now we avoided this method as it was extremely demanding in terms of computational power due to its nature. we will work on finding an alternative to make it efficient. down is the code we tried :

>Using GloVe along with embeddings trained on the student comments datasets. GloVe can capture general language patterns, while the other embeddings can capture patterns specific to the comments posted by the students.

>We read about ensemble learning which involves using the combination of predictions given by multiple models to use performance. Using this we can combine the models used by us to get a even more accurate prediction.

>WE could experiment with GRU layers as well, for now we decided to stick with LSTM since we achieved a satisfactory accuracy.
